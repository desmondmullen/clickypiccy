**ClickyPiccy is an exercise in full stack development skills with a focus on React.** I created this for the Coding Boot Camp at UNC-Chapel Hill in April 2019.

ClickyPiccy challenges players to click all twelve album covers without clicking any one of them twice. The catch is that the pictures shuffle position with each click. Game score and high score history are displayed.

In addition to the requirements of the assignment, I added play value to the game by asking users to enter their name (arcade game-style) when they earn a high score. The high scorer's name is displayed next to the high score. The highest possible score in this game is not infinite, it is 12; each time a user scores 12 he/she is considered the new high scorer. If a user enters a blank name, the high scorer name is shows as "anonymous".

To help visualize the action of choosing, each album cover "tile" zooms (enlarges) to 110% as the user's mouse hovers over it.

I made the user interface fully responsive for visually-pleasing display on any device.

The name "ClickyPiccy" makes me chuckle, so I bought the domain name and serve it from there. :)
